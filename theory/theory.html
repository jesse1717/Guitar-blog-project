                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>&ensp;&ensp;What is theory? Music theory is a way for musicians to talk about the music they are playing. For example,
                    if I played you a song, could you tell me how to play it? Could you tell me without using sounds, only words? Unless
                    you have already started your music theory journey, this might be dificult. A look at what is to come is the different notes,
                    scales, and chords in our western 12-tone system.

                <h2>Intro to Music Theory</h2>
                <p><br>Starting in our music theory journey, we have the notes of music.</p>
                <p class="example">A - B - C - D - E - F - G</p>
                <p><br>That's it, A - G. These are the 7 lettered notes in music. You may be wondering why I say lettered though. That is because there are actually more! These other 
                    notes are shown here:</p>
                <p class="example">A - A# - B - C - C# - D - D# - E - F - F# - G - G#</p>
                <p>These can also be shown like so:</p>
                <p class="example">Ab - A - Bb - B - C - Db - D - Eb - E - F - Gb - G</p>
                <p><br><b>In music theory, "#"" represents sharped notes and "b" represents flat notes. For example, "Ab" is A flat and "D#" is D Sharp.</b></p>
                <p><br>Forget about these for now though, we'll go back to the basic 7 lettered notes.</p>
                <p>We can build scales using these notes. For example, the C major scale is:</p>
                <p class="example">C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C</p>
                <p>You can see that notes do not simply end at G, they repeat! This is true no matter how high or low in pitch you go, there will always be more notes.</p>
                <p><br>The next step is to look at chords. Chords are any 3 or more notes played at once. The two most important chords are the Major and Minor chords.</p>
                <p class="example">Major: C - E - G<br>Minor: C - Eb - G</p>
                <p><br>We will discuss why the E is an Eb in a minor chord in a later lesson, but for now, try it out yourself! Notice that one feels happy and bright
                    while the other might feel sad and darker. This is your intro to expressing emotions in music!<br><br>
