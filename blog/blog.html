                <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Goose (pictured above) is one of the latest jam bands to cross the music scene. 
                    Starting small, spawning from a band named Orthelo, Goose rose to the top playing with names such as Trey Anastasio from the band 
                    Phish.<br><br>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The first time I heard Goose, fireworks appeared. I'm not kidding, it was the 
                    fourth of July and I saw literal fireworks as "Arcadia" played on the speaker. I immediately ran to find out who I was hearing on 
                    guitar. Rick Mitarotonda is who I was hearing. From there I was hooked. Rick's melody lines mixed with percussive rhythm guitar 
                    shown, but then I heard the sounds of piano shining through. Playing that piano was Peter Anspach. Also a guitarist, Peter played 
                    down the foundation of Arcadia with full and rich piano chords that ran through unique guitar pedals for a cool and modern effect. 
                    That was my sudden introduction to Goose.<br><br>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The next day I listened to no one else but them. 
                    The song that stood out that day was "So Ready". The star in this track, bass player Trevor Weekz. His hook in So Ready was stuck 
                    in my head for weeks, bouncing around not wanting to come out (and I was fine with that). A deeper dive into more of their live tracks 
                    relieved a gold mine of bass licks and rhythms that went on forever. His likeness to the greats like Phil Lesh from the Grateful Dead is 
                    prominent. Then lastly there are the drummers. To be specific, drummer and percussionist. Jeff Arevalo and Ben Atkind drive this rhythm 
                    section with a firm grip on the wheel. You can hear the classic jam band rhythms, but these two bring out the best in each other which 
                    leads to funky fills that make you rewind and re-listen.<br><br>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;If this does not make you want to 
                    listen, then do yourself a favor and put them on anyway. As anyone knows, words cannot describe magic, and magic is what Goose is.<br><br><br>
