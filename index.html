                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>&ensp;&ensp;Jesse's Guitar Lessons is my submission for my final project in CGS1821. This website uses a 
                    traditional blog-style format with the ability to scale to any amount of posts. The header shows the 4 key 
                    areas that posts would fall under. <br><br>&ensp;&ensp; The first area, blog, will feature opinion articles 
                    about musicians and their music. <br><br>&ensp;&ensp; The second area, lessons, would feature posts teaching 
                    users how to play guitar.<br><br>&ensp;&ensp; The third area, theory, would feature posts teaching music 
                    theory concepts such as scales, keys, rhythm, and more.<br><br>&ensp;&ensp; Lastly, the reference area would 
                    feature quick guides for both guitar players and musicians in general. This would include downloadable PDFs 
                    on subjects such as chord shapes, scale shapes, and more.<br><br>&ensp;&ensp; In all, I am very proud of the 
                    potential this website holds and its  possible applications in the real world.
